# Object-Oriented Programming

## DRY - Don't Repeat Yourself

### Use cases
- What is a function and why is it useful?
- Function structure and arguments
- Function best practices

## Functions
- Syntax def function_name(parameters):
- Function has to be called to run
- Feed chosen parameters into the function when called
- Return acts like a break point, returning the value and ending the block
